# Lostsons.tv
Lostsons.tv is a dockerized web application for self-hosting video clips, similar to medal.tv.

## But why? How is this better than medal.tv?
While medal.tv is fantastic for a social media experience, it lacks some basic features. The API they provide is very limited. The
one that was the genesis of my idea for creating a clone of it, was the inability to search for video clips via tag.

I wanted a Discord bot that could be queried by our discord server members to find various clips based on tags, uploaders, featured
players in the clips, etc. Almost none of this is available with the medal.tv API. I also had no need for the "social media" style
featured of medal.tv.

There's also an online contigent of those who prefer to self-host all their data, even gaming clips. Lostsons.tv solves both issues.

## Whats with the name?
The name is based on the name my group of friends and myself gave ourselves and our online presence. Depending on the game being played,
it was either our guild, clan, or team name (or rather, it's a shortened version of the original "Lost Sons of New Bedford". IYKYK).
